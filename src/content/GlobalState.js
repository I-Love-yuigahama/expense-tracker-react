import React,{createContext, useReducer} from "react";
//createContext is used to create a global context, which allows different components to share 
// data without passing props down manually at every level.

// useReducer is a React hook that manages complex state logic. Itâ€™s 
// similar to useState, but is more suitable when you have multiple states or 
// want to handle actions in a centralized way.
